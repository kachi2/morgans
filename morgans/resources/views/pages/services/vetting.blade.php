																			The Morgans Consortium provides extensive and critical pre-employment screening, vendor vetting, tenant background verification and vulnerable sector checks to help alleviate risk and liability to a broad range of organizations including small businesses, financial institutions, government and staffing agencies, healthcare providers, property managers, hotel chains and private security firms. We have the ability to search, gather, verify and report detailed information on almost anyone, anywhere in the world quickly and cost effectively allowing our clients to make informed decisions.

																			We can seamlessly integrate a screening process into any organization.  A properly resourced screening program is an investment, not a liability which effectively minimizes legal and financial exposure by proactively guarding against workplace fraud, theft, violence, negligent hiring and wrongful dismissals, ultimately saving money on the costs associated with recruiting.  Many employers who fail to take reasonable precautions about who they hire face increased risk, increased costs and may be liable for negligence.
