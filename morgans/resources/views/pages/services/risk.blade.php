														<p>As a firm, being compliant is not enough but monitoring of compliance issues is very vital. Any firm should have a comprehensive risk-based monitoring plan which will help in identifying possible regulatory risks and a measure of the likelihood of impacts it might have on the business. Compliance monitoring helps in developing risk mitigation actions which helps a firm to manage its risks.
                                                            A good compliance plan will identify the areas to be tested, how they will be tested and how frequent the tests will be done. The plan requires regular reviews by a senior management to ensure it is proactive and flexible to adapt to new and unanticipated changes and risks.

It also requires firms to conduct regular penetration tests to ensure earlier mitigation of impending risks.

                                                            Treating Customers Fairly

                                                        Regulators are keen on observance of the Treating Customers Fairly (‘TCF’) principle that is well reflected in firms PRA and FCA principles. This principle requires each firm to pay due regard to the interests of its customers and treat all of them fairly. The regulators expect firms to be keen on delivering the following outcomes on TCF:

                                                        Corporate culture is characterized by fair treatment of all customers which boosts the confidence of the customers when interacting with the firms.
                                                        Services and products which are marketed in the retail market are designed to meet the needs of the target group.
                                                        Clear information to the clients about products and services is availed before, during and after the point of sale.
                                                        Where advice is provided to the consumers, it should be suitable and take account of the consumers’ circumstances.
                                                        Consumers are provided with products or services which perform as the firms have led the consumers to expect and meet the expected standards.
                                                        Consumers should not face any barriers from the firms in case they want to switch providers, change products, submit claim or make a complaint.
                                                        The regulator terms observance and adherence to the TCF as the overall culture of the firm that should be considered on a regular basis.
                                                        Firms are tasked with creating awareness about TCF and developing strategies and plans which relate the outlined TCF principles to their business activities. Additionally, they are supposed to carry out an implementation which mainly involves provision of solutions to areas where gaps have been identified. The last task involves embedding which creates awareness to the staff on the firm’s approach to TCF.
                                                        TMC can help in the above processes in the following ways:

                                                        Assist in development of remedial actions as required under the firm’s TCF
                                                        Help in carrying out training on TCF principles

In order to ensure compliance with the EU, UK and global requirements, firms are encouraged to have the following guidance:

                                                            Ensuring they have financial crime procedures which are well documented.

                                                            A failure to comply or not having the appropriate financial crime systems and controls leads to disciplinary actions against the company. This might lead to regulatory sanctions for firms which do not provide regular trainings on financial crime prevention to its staff members.</p>

This has led to global and public sharing of personal data which has increased the ease at which data can be transmitted, collected, manipulated, stored, and disseminated. These developments and the increased awareness of fundamental rights more particularly the right to privacy have led to the emergence of new data protection regime.

                                                            The implementation of GDPR has moved the compliance to become a board level responsibility. Firms are tasked with producing evidence and steps that demonstrate total compliance to the GDPR policies. </p></div>
