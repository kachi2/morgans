This information may be aggregated to provide statistical information about the users of our Site. No individual user will be identifiable from such information, which is used to ensure the Site reflects the needs of users. Whilst IP addresses may be categorized as personal information, we do not use this data to track your session.

Your personal information is necessary to enable THE MORGANS Consortium and its subsidiaries to deal with your enquiry, but additional information may be requested to help us to provide the most appropriate response. If such additional information is requested, it is highlighted and its provision is voluntary.
<br>
<br><strong>2. Sensitive personal data </strong><br>
When you apply for one of our jobs, you will need to register with us and submit an application.
